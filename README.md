# drupal-countdown-timer | Agiledrop assignment

## Project/time management
* 1h | Project setup (phpstorm, php, composer, drupal server, imported SQL)
* 1h | XDebug config
* 4h | Reading documentation:
  * ~70% time was dedicated to learning about getting context of a node
    into a custom block. It caused me a lot of issues and then decided to use routeMatcher.
  * honestly docs are very confusing; often I have read an entire article at which point I found
    out it was for earlier versions of drupal.
  * I have strived for the use of latest standards and implementations for Drupal 9
* 2h | Building custom module
  * I have used native PHP functions to get desired outcome, but perhaps it'd be more suitable
    to use dedicated Drupal functions, especially to handle timezones.

## Tl;dr
* I have expected more issues, but it was quite a straightforward task. There is not much code and I have a feeling something is missing
* Git commits could've been more granulated, but since there is not much code, I think its not a big mistake.
* I could've read more documentation to learn about underlying Drupal architecture
* Outdated docs really got to me
* Overall I enjoyed the task
